The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle 5.2.

This release features [1](), [2](), ... [n](), and more.

We would like to thank the following community contributors to this release of Gradle:
[Thomas Broyer](https://github.com/tbroyer).

## Improvements for plugin authors 

### Service injection into project extensions

There are several [useful services](userguide/custom_tasks.html#service_injection) that Gradle makes available for task and plugin implementations to use. Previously, these were available for injection into task and plugin instances. In this Gradle release these services are also available for injection directly into project extensions. Using this can help simplify your plugin implementation.

See the [User Manual](userguide/custom_plugins.html#service_injection) for details.

TBD - can have abstract service getter
TBD - can use server getter on plugins
TBD - can use service injection on `project.container(Class)` elements 

## The Java Platform plugin

A new plugin, the [Java Platform plugin](userguide/java_platform_plugin.html) allows the declaration and publication of platforms for the Java ecosystem.
A platform is typically published as a bill-of-material (BOM) file, and can be used as a source of recommendations for versions, between projects or externally.
Read the [Java Platform plugin section of the userguide](userguide/java_platform_plugin.html) for more details.

## Maven publication: expose resolved versions

When using the [`maven-publish` plugin](userguide/publishing_maven.html), you can now opt-in to publish the _resolved_ dependency versions instead of the _declared_ ones.
For details, have a look at the [dedicated section](userguide/publishing_maven.html#publishing_maven:resolved_dependencies) in the plugin documentation.

## Support for additional Windows native toolchains

In previous versions of Gradle, native builds using GCC with [cygwin64](https://www.cygwin.com/) or [mingw64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) was reported to work, but was not officially supported.
These toolchains are now officially supported by Gradle.  See [the userguide](userguide/native_software.html#native-binaries:tool-chain-support) for more information about supported native toolchains.

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
